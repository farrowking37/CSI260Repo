Answer the following question to practice using list/dictionary comprehensions:

1. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7
2. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have the digit 3 in them
3. Remove all of the vowels in a string (can assume y is not a vowel)
4. Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters
5. Use a dictionary comprehension that maps each each word in a sentence to its length.

6. Additional Challenges:

Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit
besides 1 (2-9)
For all the numbers 1-1000, use a nested list/dictionary comprehension to find the highest single digit any of the
numbers is divisible by
